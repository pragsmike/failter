### 1 · Purpose & High-level Impression

Failter is now a **mature, CLI-centric framework for prompt-and-model experimentation**.  Its philosophy—*treat prompts as code and the filesystem as a database*—is clearly documented and faithfully implemented in the codebase and docs .  The current revision adds polished user docs, richer reports, and the first unit-test scaffolding, moving the project from “promising prototype” to something a small team could safely adopt.

---

### 2 · Documentation

* **README + USAGE + DESIGN** form a coherent trilogy: quick pitch, hands-on tutorial, and deep architecture tour.  The user guide walks through directory layout, commands, and interpretation of reports with concrete examples .
* The design doc diagrams the three-stage pipeline and explains every namespace’s responsibility .
* Cross-linking between the docs is complete, so newcomers can jump smoothly among them.

**Suggestion** – include the workflow diagram as an SVG in the repo so it renders on GitHub, not just in the ASCII block.

### 3 · Architecture & Workflow

Failter’s pipeline is now:

1. **experiment** – enumerate every `(input × template × model)` combo and write parameters to `results/…` folders.
2. **evaluate** – call a judge LLM with a detailed rubric prompt and emit `.eval` YAML.
3. **report** – aggregate front-matter metadata into both a markdown and CSV report.

The orchestration code is isolated in `experiment.clj`, and execution logic lives in `runner.clj`; the two are joined only by a thin `trial-fn` contract, a clean separation of concerns .

### 4 · Code Quality Highlights

| Module                | Notable strengths                                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **runner.clj**        | Front-matter aware: passes only the body to the LLM and writes enriched YAML on return.  It also extracts `<think>`/`<scratchpad>` blocks into `.thoughts` files for introspection. |
| **evaluator.clj**     | Skips already-graded outputs, builds a composite judge prompt, and catches errors so a single bad file doesn’t kill the run.                                                        |
| **reporter.clj**      | Groups by `(model, template)` rather than directory names, computes robust averages, and now writes both markdown and proper CSV via `clojure-csv` .                                |
| **frontmatter.clj**   | Uses `yaml/generate-string :flow-style :block` so lists always round-trip cleanly .                                                                                                 |
| **llm-interface.clj** | Logs full JSON, normalises usage/cost fields, and returns explicit `:error` maps on any failure path .                                                                              |

Overall, namespaces are single-purpose, functions are small, and error handling is consistent.

### 5 · Build & Tests

* Dependency footprint is still lean (≈ 9 runtime libs) and now includes `clojure-csv` for reporting and Cognitect’s test runner for CI .
* Two initial tests for front-matter and reporter behaviour were added (visible in the pack script), giving a scaffold for future coverage.

**Suggestion** – add mocks around `llm/call-model` so runner/evaluator logic can be unit-tested without hitting an API.

---

### 6 · Strengths Summarised

* **Prompt-as-logic**: normal people can tweak behaviour without touching code.
* **Filesystem-as-DB**: every artefact is portable and git-diffable.
* **Idempotent & resumable**: existing outputs/evals are skipped, errors are embedded in YAML.
* **Diagnostics**: `.thoughts` capture chain-of-thought for post-mortems.
* **Dual-format reports**: human-readable table plus spreadsheet-ready CSV.

### 7 · Areas for Further Polish

| Item                                      | Why it matters                                       | Quick remedy                                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hard-coded LiteLLM endpoint**           | Users may run a remote proxy.                        | Read `LITELLM_ENDPOINT` env var with localhost as default. |
| **CSV line endings**                      | Windows Excel sometimes mis-parses `\n`.             | Pass `:newline "\r\n"` to `write-csv`.                     |
| **Average cost when some runs lack cost** | Currently averages over nils → shows `0.0`.          | Filter nils before averaging in `calculate-summary`.       |
| **Judge failures leave no `.eval`**       | Down-stream tooling treats file as “not yet graded”. | Write stub YAML (`grade: "F"`, rationale) on error.        |
| **Sequential trial loop**                 | Large grids can take hours.                          | Add `--parallel N` flag using `pmap` or `core.async`.      |

None of these are architectural; each is an isolated patch.

### 8 · Road-map Ideas

1. **JSON reporter** (trivial with new `format-as-csv` helper).
2. **Web dashboard** – static HTML/HTMX that reads the CSV for interactive filtering.
3. **Multi-judge voting** – store per-judge grades in front-matter and compute consensus scores.
4. **Plugin API** – allow custom fitness metrics for evolutionary prompt search.

### 9 · Verdict

The current revision of Failter is **production-ready for small- to medium-scale prompt experimentation**.  Clear docs, tidy Clojure code, and robust file-based artefacts make it practical for teams who care about reproducibility and audit trails. Addressing the small nits above and growing test coverage will lock in long-term maintainability, but the core engine is solid and thoughtfully engineered.
