## üß† Concept & Design

**Failter** is a highly modular, CLI-first framework for LLM-based text transformation experiments. It stands out for its:

* Prompt-centric architecture
* Model-agnostic design via [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)
* Automation of evaluation and reporting
* Clean, introspectable outputs using YAML frontmatter

These design choices are solid and well-justified, especially for iterative research workflows involving prompt and model comparison.

---

## ‚úÖ Strengths

### 1. **Excellent Modularity**

Each responsibility is cleanly separated into its own namespace:

* `runner`: single trial execution
* `experiment`: trial orchestration
* `evaluator`: LLM-based grading
* `reporter`: aggregation & metrics
* `frontmatter`: YAML parsing
* `llm-interface`: LiteLLM abstraction

This makes the system easy to maintain, extend, or even re-platform.

---

### 2. **Thoughtful Evaluation Process**

The judge model is given a detailed and well-written prompt that emphasizes fidelity to the instructions. It outputs structured YAML grades with rationale, which can be automatically parsed and included in reports.

This level of rigor is rare in tooling aimed at prompt engineering.

---

### 3. **Resilience Built-In**

* Skips previously completed trials and evaluations
* Records errors in frontmatter instead of crashing
* Retry-safe and deterministic structure using filesystem-as-database approach

These are signs of mature, practical design thinking.

---

### 4. **Rich Diagnostics**

Capturing `<think>` or `<scratchpad>` tags into `.thoughts` files is a brilliant idea. It gives users insight into *why* a model responded a certain way‚Äîessential when comparing behaviors across models.

---

### 5. **Minimal External Dependencies**

Just a few thoughtful Clojure libraries (`clj-http`, `cheshire`, `clj-yaml`, `tools.cli`) keep the project lean.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Suggestions for Improvement

### 1. **Execution Context Awareness**

Currently, `evaluate` assumes the output filename matches the input. If output filenames are renamed (e.g., hash-based deduplication), this might break. Suggestion:

* Add `input-filename` or hash to frontmatter
* Use that to reconstruct paths more robustly

---

### 2. **Graceful Fallbacks for Judge Model Errors**

When judge model calls fail:

* Currently, no `.eval` file is written
* Consider writing a stub `.eval` with `"grade: F"` and `"rationale: Judge LLM failed"`

---

### 3. **Report Usability**

Consider offering:

* CSV or JSON export option
* Web/HTML visualization (even via static HTML)
* Grade trends over time (versioned experiments)

---

### 4. **Workflow Diagram and Example Pack**

As noted earlier, a rendered architecture or flowchart + tiny experiment (`inputs/`, `templates/`, `models.txt`) would help new users a lot.

---

### 5. **Unit Tests**

There is a test alias in `deps.edn`, but no `test/` folder or test code included in the archive. Would suggest:

* Adding basic tests for frontmatter parsing and model response parsing
* Using fixtures to validate prompt injection

---

## üß© Unique Ideas That Stand Out

* **Prompt-as-logic** via natural language templates
* **Judge-as-evaluator** separated from transformers
* **Filesystem-as-state** for idempotency and traceability
* **Monologue scraping** for introspection of chain-of-thought

All of these are forward-thinking patterns that align with the future of LLM tooling.

---

## üèÅ Verdict

**Failter is a thoughtfully engineered, practical, and extensible tool for rigorous LLM evaluation.** It combines software engineering discipline with LLM-native design philosophy and is suitable for serious experimentation work.

If you plan to continue developing it, it has the potential to serve:

* Prompt engineers tuning transformations
* Researchers comparing LLM behavior
* Developers seeking clean LLM pipelines

Would you like recommendations for packaging it as a public CLI tool, or adapting it for GUI use?
