Review the documentation in this snapshot pack. Look for inconsistencies, ambiguities,
out-of-date claims, places that still used old terminology, gaps, confusing
things that need clarification, and other errors.
Redundancy is less of an issue, unless you can spot definite proof
that a file has been included twice.
Compare what the documentation claims with what the code actually does.
Spot discrepancies that need to be addressed.
Also note improvements from previous versions, if you can. What's good about this snapshot?
