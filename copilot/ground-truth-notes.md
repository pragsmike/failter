That is a fantastic idea and a very powerful evolution for the framework. Moving from a purely "rules-based" evaluation to a "ground-truth-based" evaluation represents a significant step up in analytical rigor.

Here is an analysis of the problems and missing implications of this plan, as requested.

### The Plan is Solid: Core Concept

The core concept is to introduce an optional `ground-truth/` directory within an experiment. For any input file, say `inputs/article1.md`, a user can provide a corresponding `ground-truth/article1.md` file. The evaluator would then use this "perfect" file as a reference to judge the quality of the LLM's generated output.

This is a great plan. Here are the implications and potential issues to consider before implementation.

### Key Implications & Design Decisions

These are not problems, but rather necessary design choices and consequences of the new feature.

**1. Directory Structure Convention:**
*   **Implication:** We need a strict, clear convention for how ground truth files are stored and named. A parallel directory structure is the most logical choice:
    ```
    my-experiment/
    ├── inputs/
    │   └── article1.md
    └── ground-truth/
        └── article1.md   <-- Must have the same name as its input counterpart
    ```
*   **Decision:** The `evaluator` will be responsible for checking `if ground-truth/filename exists` for each trial it processes.

**2. Optionality is Critical:**
*   **Implication:** This feature must be optional *per input file*. The entire system must function perfectly if the `ground-truth/` directory is missing, or if it contains files for only some of the inputs.
*   **Decision:** The `evaluator`'s logic must fork. For a given trial, it will check for a ground truth file.
    *   **If Found:** It will use the ground-truth evaluation method.
    *   **If Not Found:** It will fall back to the existing rules-based evaluation method.

**3. A New "Judge" Prompt is Required:**
*   **Implication:** The task for the judge model changes fundamentally. It's no longer just "did the model follow the rules in this prompt?" but "how close is this output to the ground truth, considering these rules?"
*   **Decision:** We will need a new or heavily modified evaluation prompt template (e.g., `evaluation-prompt-gt.md`). This new prompt would have a new placeholder, `{{GROUND_TRUTH_OUTPUT}}`, and would instruct the judge:
    > "You will be given an `ORIGINAL_INPUT`, a `GENERATED_OUTPUT`, and an ideal `GROUND_TRUTH_OUTPUT`. Your primary task is to assess how closely the `GENERATED_OUTPUT` matches the `GROUND_TRUTH_OUTPUT` in terms of content, structure, and tone. Use the `PROMPT_TEMPLATE` as context for understanding what was removed, but prioritize similarity to the ground truth."

**4. The Report Must Reflect the Evaluation Method:**
*   **Missing Implication:** If an experiment contains a mix of ground-truth and rules-based evaluations, the final report could be misleading because the scores aren't directly comparable (they were derived from different grading criteria).
*   **Decision:**
    1.  The `evaluator` should add a new key to the `.eval` file's content, such as `evaluation-method: "ground-truth"` or `evaluation-method: "rules-based"`.
    2.  The `reporter` should be updated to read this key and add a new `Eval_Method` column to the report. This makes the report self-documenting and the results transparent.

### Potential Problems & Mitigations

These are the potential pitfalls we need to be mindful of during design and implementation.

**1. Defining "Closeness" is Subjective:**
*   **Problem:** An LLM judge might penalize a generated output for being stylistically different from the ground truth, even if it is semantically identical and equally correct. For example, rephrasing a sentence or changing the order of non-essential paragraphs. Is that an "F" or an "A"?
*   **Mitigation:** The new judge prompt must be expertly crafted. It should be instructed to focus on **semantic and structural equivalence**, not a simple character-by-character `diff`. It should be told to tolerate minor, meaning-preserving stylistic variations.

**2. The Risk of Overfitting:**
*   **Problem:** If you only have one or two hand-crafted ground truth files, you might optimize your prompt to work perfectly for those specific examples. This "overfitted" prompt may then perform poorly on a wider, more diverse range of inputs not represented by your ground truth set.
*   **Mitigation:** This is a user-level concern that should be addressed in the documentation (`USAGE.md`). We should advise users to either:
    *   Provide a diverse set of ground truth files that represent the full range of expected inputs.
    *   Use ground-truth evaluation in combination with rules-based evaluation across many other files to ensure the prompt is robust and generalizable.

**3. Increased Cost and Complexity:**
*   **Problem:** The new judge prompt will be significantly longer because it includes the entire ground truth text. This will increase the token count for each evaluation, making the `evaluate` step more expensive and potentially slower.
*   **Mitigation:** This is an unavoidable trade-off for higher-quality evaluation. The documentation should make this clear to the user. They are trading cost for accuracy. The benefit of having a definitive "correct" answer to compare against likely outweighs the cost increase.

In summary, the plan is excellent and has no blocking issues, but it requires careful implementation of the evaluator's logic fork, expert crafting of the new judge prompt, and updates to the reporting to ensure the results remain clear and transparent.
