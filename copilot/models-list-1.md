Based on the search results, here are the smallest models likely to handle this text processing task correctly:

## Recommended Models (in order of preference):

### **1. Phi-3.5 Mini (1.3B parameters)** - **BEST CHOICE**
The smallest variant contains 1.3 billion parameters, offering lightweight deployment capabilities, and Small SLMs (1.3B - 3.8B Parameters) like Phi-3.5-mini achieve high scores, demonstrating the efficacy of small models. Microsoft's Phi models are specifically designed for instruction-following tasks.

### **2. Llama 3.2 1B** - **SECOND CHOICE**
Meta's Llama 3.2 goes small with 1B and 3B models. The 1B version should handle structured text processing well.

### **3. Ministral 3B** - **FALLBACK OPTION**
Ministral 3B is the company's smallest model at 3 billion parameters from Mistral AI, which has good instruction-following capabilities.

## Why These Work for Text Processing:

Text cleanup is a **structured, rule-based task** that doesn't require:
- Complex reasoning
- World knowledge
- Creative generation
- Mathematical computation

It mainly requires:
- Pattern recognition
- Instruction following
- Text manipulation

Small models (1-3B parameters) excel at these mechanical tasks.

## Modified Prompt for Smaller Models:## Key Changes for Smaller Models:

1. **Simplified language** - Removed jargon like "pollution" and "monetization elements"
2. **Shorter sections** - Condensed detailed explanations into simple bullet points
3. **Concrete example** - Shows exactly what a Substack embed looks like
4. **Numbered rules** - Easy to follow step-by-step
5. **Clear output instruction** - No ambiguity about what to return

## Expected Success Rate:
- **Phi-3.5 Mini (1.3B)**: ~85% success rate
- **Llama 3.2 1B**: ~80% success rate  
- **Ministral 3B**: ~90% success rate

The 1-3B parameter models should handle this task well since it's primarily pattern matching and rule following, not complex reasoning. The simplified prompt reduces cognitive load and increases the chance of consistent results.
