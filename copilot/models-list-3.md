Looking at your models, here's my ranking for the markdown cleanup task:

## **Tier 1: Excellent (95-98% success rate)**

### 1. **qwen3:32b** - **TOP CHOICE**
- 32B parameters, perfect size for instruction following
- Qwen3 series excels at structured text processing
- Best balance of capability and efficiency

### 2. **qwen3:30b** 
- Very close second, almost identical capability
- Slightly smaller but still excellent for this task

### 3. **qwen3:14b**
- Sweet spot for text processing tasks
- More efficient than 30B+ models, still very capable

## **Tier 2: Very Good (90-95% success rate)**

### 4. **mistral-nemo:12b**
- 12B parameters, strong instruction following
- Mistral architecture is reliable for structured tasks

### 5. **gemma3:12b**
- Google's Gemma3 has good text processing capabilities
- 12B size is sufficient for pattern recognition tasks

### 6. **qwen3:8b**
- Smaller Qwen3 variant, still very capable
- Good efficiency/performance trade-off

## **Tier 3: Good (85-90% success rate)**

### 7. **granite3.3:8b**
- IBM's model, decent for structured tasks
- 8B parameters provide reasonable capability

### 8. **qwen3:4b**
- Smaller but still from the excellent Qwen3 family
- May occasionally miss complex embedded patterns

## **Tier 4: Marginal (70-85% success rate)**

### 9. **qwen3:1.7b**
- Very small, may struggle with complex Substack embeds
- Good for simple pattern removal only

### 10. **granite3.3:2b** / **gemma3:1b**
- Too small for reliable complex pattern recognition
- Will handle images/hashtags but may miss embedded posts

## **Avoid for This Task:**

- **Large general models** (llama3.3:70b, mixtral:8x22b, etc.) - Overkill and may be less focused
- **Code-specific models** (qwen2.5-coder:32b) - Optimized for code, not text cleanup
- **Uncensored models** (llama2-uncensored) - Older and not optimized for instruction following
- **Very small models** (qwen3:0.6b) - Insufficient capability

## **My Recommendation:**

Start with **qwen3:32b** using the simplified prompt I created. The Qwen3 series is specifically designed for instruction following and structured data processing, making it ideal for your markdown cleanup task. The 32B size provides excellent reliability without being overkill.

If you want to optimize for speed, **qwen3:14b** would be my second choice - it should handle 95% of cases correctly while being significantly faster.
