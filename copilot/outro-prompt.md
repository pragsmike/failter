Write an onboarding document for your successor. Reiterate the prime directives
and rules for collaboration that you were given at the start, as well as others
that you learned during this session. Reflect on the mistakes you made, explain
what they were and how they happened, and advise how to avoid them.
Describe the state of the project, especially the parts that are not
covered in the README.md, docs/DESIGN.md, and USAGE.md documents.
Outline the next steps to be done on the project, and any details
that will help your successor to carry out the plan.
