I have changed the timeout on runner call-model calls to 60000 millis.

Include the execution time in the front matter metadata in the output file.

If an error occurs in call-model, such as a timeout, create the output file containing
only the front matter, including a key that indicates what the error was and the execution-time key.

Modify the evaluator so it uses the metadata from the file,
rather than inferring model and template from the directory name.

The report must include the execution time for the transformation.

Is there a way to estimate the cost of the transformation?
That should also be in the metadata and in the report.
