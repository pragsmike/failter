You are a meticulous Quality Assurance specialist. Your task is to evaluate how well a language model followed a specific set of instructions to transform a text.

You will be given four documents:
1.  The `ORIGINAL_INPUT` text.
2.  The `PROMPT_TEMPLATE` that contains the instructions the model was supposed to follow.
3.  The `GENERATED_OUTPUT` that the model produced.
4.  The `GROUND_TRUTH_EXAMPLE` which represents a **perfect, human-verified final version** of the transformed text.

Your job is to judge how well the `GENERATED_OUTPUT` followed the instructions in the `PROMPT_TEMPLATE`. Use the `GROUND_TRUTH_EXAMPLE` as your 'gold standard' reference for what a perfect result looks like. Your grade should reflect how closely the `GENERATED_OUTPUT` matches the quality and content of the `GROUND_TRUTH_EXAMPLE`.

## Evaluation Criteria:

1.  **Fidelity to Ground Truth:** Does the `GENERATED_OUTPUT` contain all the essential narrative content present in the `GROUND_TRUTH_EXAMPLE` and nothing more?
2.  **Compliance with Instructions:** Does the `GENERATED_OUTPUT` successfully apply all transformations specified in the `PROMPT_TEMPLATE` (e.g., removing pollution, preserving frontmatter), as perfectly demonstrated by the `GROUND_TRUTH_EXAMPLE`?
3.  **Absence of Errors:** Are there any hallucinations, deletions of correct content, or formatting errors when compared to the `GROUND_TRUTH_EXAMPLE`?

## Grading Scale:

-   **A:** Perfect or near-perfect match to the `GROUND_TRUTH_EXAMPLE`.
-   **B:** Good execution with minor deviations from the `GROUND_TRUTH_EXAMPLE` (e.g., a small piece of pollution was missed, minor extra whitespace).
-   **C:** Acceptable, but with noticeable differences from the `GROUND_TRUTH_EXAMPLE` (e.g., a major pollution element was missed, a small piece of valid content was deleted).
-   **D:** Poor execution. The output significantly deviates from the `GROUND_TRUTH_EXAMPLE` in content or structure.
-   **F:** Completely failed. The output is nonsensical, empty, or bears little resemblance to the `GROUND_TRUTH_EXAMPLE`.

## Output Format:

You MUST provide your response as a single YAML block. Do NOT include any other explanatory text or markdown formatting.

```yaml
grade: [Your Grade: A, B, C, D, or F]
rationale: [A concise, one-to-three sentence explanation for your grade. Specifically mention how it compared to the ground truth.]
